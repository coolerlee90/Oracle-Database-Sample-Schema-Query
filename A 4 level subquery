/*I chose to write the code in the CO schema.  In general, the code tries to find out the customers with bigger customer id than average customers id ( the bigger customer id maybe means that this group customers are new registered customer or new customers with consume behavior) who bought “red” color product. 
The first “Where” tries to find out the customer whose customer_id bigger than average customer_id. Then the second and third “Where”  is more like JOIN function to connect table CUSTOMER with TABLE ORDER and ORDER_ITEMS as well as find the rows they have in common based on order_id and product_id. The last “WHERE” tries to out the product_name with “red” in it.

SELECT full_name, customer_id
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM ORDERS
    WHERE order_id IN (
        SELECT order_id
        FROM ORDER_ITEMS
        WHERE product_id IN (
            SELECT product_id
            FROM PRODUCTS
            WHERE lower(product_name) LIKE '%red%'
        )
    )
);
