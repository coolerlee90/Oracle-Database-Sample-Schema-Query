/*I chose to write the code in the CO schema.  Generally, this part tries to find out the total expense for each order and the price for each kind of product in each order.
First, the code finds out the “TOTAL” for each product in each order which is the “row data”. Then “UNION” these results with next part. The second “TOTAL” is the expense of each order. The “GROUP BY ORDER_ID” constraints the TOTAL just focus on the expense in one ORDER_ID.
