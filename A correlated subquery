/* I chose to write the code in the CO schema.  Generally, this part tries to find out the order whose “Total” expense higher than average expense with LINE_ITEM_ID=1.
There are two constraints in this “WHERE” syntax, one is LINE_ITEM_ID=1, another is a correlated subquery which decide whether UNIT_PRICE*QUANTITY >AVG(UNIT_PRICE*QUANTITY). */
