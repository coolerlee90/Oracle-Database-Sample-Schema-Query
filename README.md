# Oracle-Database-Sample-Schema-Query

SQL project in Fall semester (Sep-Dec) 2023

Thanks to professor Jim Myronic guidance

1)	Install the Oracle sample schemas

Confirmation the schemas have been successfully installed;

2)	Query the installed schemas

From SQL Developer or SQL Plus, the SQL DML query and query results (i.e., result set) that successfully demonstrate:

i.	The joining of 5 tables (Note: add a row to one table that requires an outer join);

ii.	A 4 level subquery (i.e., 3 inner queries feeding a result to the outer query);

iii.	A SET query showing row and aggregate values;

iv.	A correlated subquery;

v.	Use of analytic functions: SUM(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), LEAD(), LAG() and CUME_DIST(), each involving PARTITION clauses.

Here are the first few pictures after I success installed the mksample.sql, which include BI, HR, IX, OE, PM, SH schemas:

I found the mksample.sql does not include all the schemas. Then, except these schemas, I tried to install the CO and QS schemas individually.
For CO schema:

Then I checked all the schema usersâ€™ status:

Then connected my sql developer with all these schemas:

I found that there are just 5 tables in the CO schema, and these 5 tables connect by primary and foreign keys. These keys are product_id, order_id, customer_id, store_id.
